## Penguin Parametric CI

**Q1: What is the sample size, n?**

The sample size is 123L

```{r}
require(palmerpenguins)
Gentoo = subset(penguins, species == "Gentoo")

n = sum(!is.na(Gentoo$bill_length_mm))
```

**Q2: What is the sample standard deviation?**

The Standard Deviation is .089.

```{r}
sd((!is.na(Gentoo$bill_length_mm)))
```

**Q3: What are the critical t-values?**

The critical t-value is 1.979
```{r}
alpha = 0.05
t_crit = abs(qt(alpha / 2, df = n - 1))
```

**Q4: What is the sample standard error?

The sample standard error is 0.277

```{r}
sse_gentoo = sd(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n)
```

**Q5: Finally construct the CI**

```{r}
# The CI is the sample mean +/- the radius:
mean(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, trim = 0, na.rm = TRUE)

# 4: Calculate the CI radius:
gentoo_radius = sse_gentoo * t_crit

Gentoo_ci = c(
  lower = mean(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE) - gentoo_radius,
  upper = mean(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE) + gentoo_radius)

print(round(Gentoo_ci, 4))
```

## Penguin Bootstrap

**Q6: What is the CI?

The CI is   2.5%: 46.96585    97.5%: 48.05251 

**Q7: Show the r code you used to call the boot() function.**

```{r}
m = 10000
result = numeric(m)
head(result)
for(i in 1:m)
{
  result[i] = mean(sample(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, m, replace=TRUE, !is.na(Gentoo$bill_length_mm)))
}

mean(result)
quantile(result,c(0.025,0.975))

#install.packages("boot")
require(boot)
boot_mean = function(x, i)
{
  return(mean(x[i], na.rm = TRUE))
  
}

myboot_bill =
  boot(
    data = Gentoo$bill_length_mm,
    statistic = boot_mean,
    R = 10000)

print(myboot_bill)
```

**Q8: Show the r code you used to calculate the upper and lower 2.5% quantiles.**

```{r}
str(myboot_bill)
mean(sample(Gentoo$bill_length_mm, m, replace=TRUE, !is.na(Gentoo$bill_length_mm)))
myboot_bill$t0
mean(myboot_bill$t) - myboot_bill$t0
sd(myboot_bill$t)

quantile(
  myboot_bill$t,
  c(0.025, 0.975))
```
## Refaction Sampler

**Q9: Show your completed rarefaction_sampler() function.

```{r}
require(here)
moths = read.csv(here("data", "moths.csv"))
head(moths)

moth_dat = moths[,-1]
head(moth_dat)

rarefaction_sampler = function(input_dat, n_iterations)
{
  n = nrow(moth_dat) #number of rows or sample observations
  m = 100
  
  n_input_rows = nrow(input_dat)
  
  results_out = matrix(
    nrow = n_iterations,
    ncol = n_input_rows)
  
  # The outer loop: runs once for each bootstrap iteration.  index variable is i
  for(i in 1:n_iterations)
  {
    # The inner loop: simulates increasing sampling intensity
    # Sampling intensity ranges from 1 site to the complete count of
    # sites in the input data (n)
    # index variable is j
    for(j in 1:n)
    {
      # sample the input data row indices, with replacement
      rows_j = sample(n, size = j, replace=TRUE)
      
      # Creates a new data matrix
      t1 = input_dat[rows_j, ]
      
      # Calculates the column sums
      t2 = apply(t1, 2, sum)
      
      # Counts the number of columns in which any moths were observed
      results_out[i, j] = sum(t2 > 0)
    }
  }
  return(results_out)
}

rarefact = rarefaction_sampler(moth_dat, 100)
head(rarefact)

```

**Q10 (1 pt.): What did you find most difficult about building the function?**

Having to figure out and understand how to get the code to work. I only found one thing wrong with it to make it work. 

**Q11 (4 pts.): Show the code you used to perform the simulations and construct the curve.**

```{r}
moths = read.csv(here("data", "moths.csv"))
rarefact = rarefaction_sampler(moths[,-1], 10000)

rare_mean = apply(rarefact, 2, mean)
rare_quant = apply(rarefact, 2, quantile, probs=c(0.025, 0.975))
rare = t(rbind(rare_mean, rare_quant))

matplot(
  rare,
  type='l',
  xlab='Number of sampling plots',
  ylab='Moth Sampling',
  main="Rarefaction Curve")

legend(
  'bottomright',
  legend=c('mean','2.5%','97.5%'),
  lty=c(1,2,3),col=c(1,2,3), inset=c(.1,.1))

```

**Q13 (2 pts.): About how many sites should you visit if you want to see all of the moth species? Explain your reasoning using your rarefaction curve figure.**

I would visit about 23 sites because thats where the 97.5%, 2.5% and the mean meet where its the highest number of sampling. 


There is strong relationship that there is a non negative relationships. 
the relationship is negative
