```{r}
require(here)
dat_gink <- read.csv(here("data", "ginkgo_data_2022.csv"))
```


**Q1 (1 pt.): How many trees are in the dataset?**
```{r}
site_id_columns = unique(dat_gink$site_id, imcomparables = FALSE)
site_id_columns
```


Q2 (1 pt.): How many trees had seeds?

```{r}
seeds_present = unique(dat_gink$seeds_present,incomparables = FALSE)
seeds_present
```


Q3 (1 pt.): Include a conditional boxplot of one of the continuous variables conditioned on the seeds_present column in your report.



Q4 (1 pt.): Based on your boxplot, do you think there is any difference betwen seed bearing and non seed bearing trees? Note: this is just a preliminary data exploration, you may change your mind based on further analysis!


Q5 (1 pt.): Create a scatterplot of max leaf depth (x) and max leaf width (y).


Q6 (1 pt.): Qualitatively describe the patterns you see in the scatterplot.


Q7 (1 pt.): Explain how our data collection procedure might have violated the fixed x assumption.


Q8 (1 pt.): Name 1 or more concepts youâ€™d like me to review or discuss in more detail.
