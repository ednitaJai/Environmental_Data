## ANOVA by Hand

**Q1: Submit the code you used to build your ANOVA by hand. Make sure you use the code template so that you use the same variable names as those which weâ€™ll use for the grading.**

```{r}

require(here)
rm(list = ls())

rope = read.csv(here("data", "rope.csv"))
rope$rope.type = factor(rope$rope.type)
rope_names <- levels(rope$rope.type)
rope$rope.type

n_obs = nrow(rope)

boxplot(p.cut ~ rope.type, data = rope)

n_groups = length(rope_names)

#SS Tot for p.cut
mean_pcut <- mean(rope$p.cut)
p_resids <- rope$p.cut - mean_pcut
squ_resids <- p_resids^2
sum_presids <- sum(squ_resids)
ss_tot = sum(squ_resids)

agg_resids <- aggregate(
  x = rope$p.cut,
  by = list(rope$rope.type),
  FUN = function(x) x-mean(x))
str(agg_resids)

agg_sum_sq_resids <- aggregate(
  x = rope$p.cut,
  by = list(rope$rope.type),
  FUN = function(x) sum((x - mean(x))^2))
str(agg_sum_sq_resids)

ss_within <- sum(agg_sum_sq_resids$x)

ss_among = ss_tot - ss_within

df_tot = n_obs - 1
df_within = n_obs - n_groups
df_among = n_groups - 1

ms_among  =  ss_among / (n_groups - 1)
ms_within = ss_within / (n_obs - n_groups)

f_ratio =  ms_among / ms_within
f_pval =  1 - pf(f_ratio, df_among, df_within)


# number comparison tolerance
digits_check = 5

# Build the reference model using R functions
fit_1 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope)
anova(fit_1)
anova_fit_1 = anova(fit_1)

anova_fit_1$"Sum Sq"

# Check degrees of freedom
anova_fit_1$Df == c(df_among, df_within)

# Check sums of squares
round(anova_fit_1$`Sum Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ss_among, ss_within), digits = digits_check)

# Check mean squares
round(anova_fit_1$`Mean Sq`, digits = digits_check) == round(c(ms_among, ms_within), digits = digits_check)

# Check the F-ratio
round(anova_fit_1$`F value`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_ratio, digits = digits_check)

# Check the F test statistic p-value
round(anova_fit_1$`Pr(>F)`[1], digits = digits_check) == round(f_pval, digits = digits_check)



rope2 = droplevels(
  subset(
    rope,
    rope.type %in% c("PI", "VEL", "XTC"))
)

boxplot(
  p.cut ~ rope.type,
  data = rope2,
  las = 2,
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "Proportion Rope Cut",
  main = "Subset of Rope Data")
mtext("Rope Type", side = 1, line = 3)


fit_rope_2 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data=rope2)

rope2_hsd = TukeyHSD(aov(fit_rope_2))

class(rope2_hsd)

round(rope2_hsd$rope.type, digits = 4)
```


## Model Assumptions: Constant Variance

**Q2: Examine the conditional box plot in the Partitioning Variance: Within-Group section of the walk-through. Based on the figure, do you think there are equal variances among the groups?**

I do not think there are equal variances among the groups.


**Q3: Conduct a Bartlett test to assess the homogeneity of variances of the percent cut among the rope type groups.**

```{r}
bartlett.test(p.cut ~ rope.type, data = rope)
```

**Q4: Given your graphical assessment (question 2) and the Bartlett test, do you think an ANOVA-type analysis is appropriate on the raw data? Explain why or why not.**

the p-value is under .05 therefore we reject the null hypothesis because there are variances within the variances. 

## Model coefficients and group means

**Q5: Which rope type is the base case?**

Blaze is the base case

```{r}
fit_rope_1 = lm(p.cut ~ rope.type, data = rope)
summary(fit_rope_1)
```

**Q6: What is the mean percent cut of the base case rope? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.**

The mean percent cut of the base case rope is 0.36714

**Q7: What is the mean percent cut rope type XTC? Show your calculation using value(s) from the model coefficient table.**

The mean percent cut rope type XTC is .2655

```{r}
.36714 - .10164
```

## Model Assumptions: Residual Normality

**Q8: Use the residuals() function to retrieve the residuals from your model and perform an overall normality test. Report the p-value.**

The p- value is 7.238e-07

```{r}
residuals(fit_rope_1)
shapiro.test(residuals(fit_rope_1))
```

**Q9: Do your model residuals meet the normality assumption, and how do you know?**

The model does meet the normality assumption because the p-value is < .01. 

**Q10: Perform normality tests on the residuals within each group. How many groups meet the normality assumption?**

```{r}
res_within <- sapply(agg_resids$x, function(x) shapiro.test(x)$p)
```

**Q11: Given the results of your tests for residual normality, do you think that a one-way Analysis of Variance is appropriate for this dataset?**

I do think that a one-way analysis of variance is appropiate for this data set because we are looking at the each individual group type. 

## Post-Hoc Testing

**Q12: Create a conditional boxplot of the female penguins: body mass conditioned on species.**

```{r}
require(palmerpenguins)
pen_fem = subset(penguins, sex == "female")

boxplot(
  body_mass_g ~ species,
  data = pen_fem,
  las = 2,
  xlab = "Species",
  ylab = "Body Mass (g)",
  main = "Body Mass (g) of Female Penguins")
```


**Q13: Based on the boxplot, do you anticipate any problems with residual normality, or homogeneity of variances? Why or why not?**

I anticipate there isn't going to be any problems in the residual normality or the homogeneity of variances because the independent groups have an equal variance. 

**Q14: Conduct a Bartlett test for homogeneity of variances of body mass grouped by species. Hint: use the formula notation. Report the p-value. Is the homogeneity assumption met? Why or why not?**

The p-value is 0.9056, therefore we accept the null hypothesis because there are no variances within between the species. 

```{r}
bartlett.test(body_mass_g ~ species, data = pen_fem)
```

**Q15: Fit a linear model of body mass (the response) and species (the predictor) using the female penguin data. Conduct a test for normality of the residuals. Report the p-value. Is the residual normality assumption met? Why or why not?**

The p-value is .3639. The residual assumption is met because the p-valus is over .05 which means that is insufficient evidence to question the assertion and so you should treat the assertion as reasonable.

```{r}
pen_fem_1 = lm(body_mass_g ~ species, data = pen_fem)

summary(pen_fem_1)

residuals(pen_fem_1)

shapiro.test(residuals(pen_fem_1))
```


**Q16: Conduct a Tukey HSD post-hoc test on your model. Which pair or pairs of species have significantly different body masses?**

Gentoo - Adelie and Gentoo-Chinstrap have a significantly different body masses. 

```{r}
pen_fem_hsd = TukeyHSD(aov(pen_fem_1))

class(pen_fem_hsd)

round(pen_fem_hsd$species, digits = 4)
```

**Q17: Describe how your HSD rest results match, or do not match, the graphical insight from the conditional boxplot.**

The HSD Rest result does not match the graphical insignt from the conditional boxplot. The HSD result shows that there is variance whereas, the conditional boxplot does not show this difference.
